            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The piano is one of the most popular and versatile musical instruments in the world. Its history spans over 300 years, evolving from early keyboard instruments to the modern grand and upright pianos we know today.</p>
            <h2>Early Instruments</h2>
            <p>The history of the piano begins with earlier keyboard instruments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Harpsichord:</b> Developed in the 15th century, it produced sound by plucking strings.</li>
                <li><b>Clavichord:</b> A more intimate instrument that allowed for expressive playing by varying pressure on the keys.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Invention of the Piano</h2>
            <p>The piano was invented in the early 1700s by Bartolomeo Cristofori, an Italian instrument maker. The first piano, known as the "gravicembalo col piano e forte," allowed players to control the volume of sound by varying the force with which they struck the keys.</p>
            
            <h2>Development in the 18th and 19th Centuries</h2>
            <p>Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the piano underwent significant changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Fortepiano:</b> The early pianos were called fortepianos, which had a softer sound compared to modern pianos.</li>
                <li><b>Revolution:</b>  Advances in technology allowed for the mass production of pianos, making them more accessible.</li>
                <li><b>Grand Piano:</b>The design of the grand piano was perfected, allowing for richer sound and greater dynamic range.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Modern Piano</h2>
            <p>Today, pianos come in various forms, including grand pianos, upright pianos, and digital pianos. The modern piano has 88 keys and is a staple in classical, jazz, and popular music.</p>
        
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The piano's rich history reflects its evolution as an instrument that has shaped music across cultures and genres. Its ability to convey emotion and complexity continues to inspire musicians and audiences alike.</p>
